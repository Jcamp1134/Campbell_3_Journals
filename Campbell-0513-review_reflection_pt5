I was succesful with creating my array, because i did remember that array
journal we had a while back, it just took some looking.
Some questions i think will be on the test are:
1. How to set up a working array
2. How to call arrays across methods and classes
3. Set up a custom array
4. call X and Y in array
5. Set certain values to certain objects such as health and weapons
6. Set up correct class constructors
7. How to change an array correctly
8. How to assign certain objects to different arrays
9. Ask the user for input
10. Use an array correctly and initialize objects to them
