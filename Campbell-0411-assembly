An assembly is a language program only containing the code necessary to
preform the task given and gives direct and complete control over system
hardware.
It is good for speed, space-efficiency and simplness.
An assembly is different from java for the fact that it is not portable and is
more difficult than java.
java is a low level language and assembly is a high level.
