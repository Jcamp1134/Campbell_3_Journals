An array is sorta like a "Container" to hold a given value.
To create a String array one would have to jsut declare an array a 
string and give it an initial size.
A correct syntax for a 2-D array would need a large array of any data
type.
A correct syntax foe a 3-D array would need multiple large arrays of
any data.
For a 1-D array to work and to change the value of it you would need
a basic code such as: int[] nums = new int[4]; and just change the 
initial size.
Basic syntax for a while loop is quite simple for the fact that mostly
every while loop is set up the same way as seen in this example:
class WhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int count = 1;
        while (count < 11) {
            System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
            count++;
        }
    }
}
If you want to call a method inside of main you would basic array
lists and "publics".
Its is recomended to use cammelCasing when using a scanner input to
keep track of what youre doing and just make it easier to read.
We would use different methods when moving the protagonist to insure a
clean and mess free code.
Some values we would pass across methods are: Public, private, and static.
