I finally found out how to fix my "Blocked" problem so that jsut about
finished my game. And to finish my game faster i set most of the Skeltons to
spawn in random areas around the map, thus saving lots of time creating
each of the enemies. I was able to complete my game on time with a win
objective, a cool map, enemies, the hero and a win and lose screen.
