I created a slick game that has the player find a golden heart before either a
"Curse" or the enemies kill him. I solved challenges such as map problems and
the amount of time it takes for the player to die and the amount of damage the
monsters do. Before winter break i was not able to complete my map but i did
create the new sprite sheats for my Protagonist and the Antagonists. I was not
able to meet the timeline in the fact that i was not able to get my "Blocked"
working so the player could move through walls thus giving my game no point.
