To make the orb move we will have to use the players location, plus the 
direction of the last clicked arrow key as seen here:
if (orb1.getDirection() == 0) {
                    orb1.setX((int) player.x);
                    orb1.setY(orb1.getY() - 5);
This part of the entire orb code sees if the player is looking up and if the 
spacebar is pressed while his direction is "0" then the orb will fire upwards.
