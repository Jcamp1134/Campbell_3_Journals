1. How do we make a class?
public class Donut {
	
}

2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
Is this a class constructor?
No, because its creating another donut - its calling the class constructor
with Donut(); 

3. How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
public class Breakfast {
	boolean hasEggs;
	int numOfEggs;
	boolean hasBacon;
	boolean hasOrangeJuice;
	int slicesOfbacon;

	Breakfast(int a, int b, boolean c, boolean d, boolean e) {
		this.numOfEggs = a;
		this. slicesOfBacon = b;
		this.hasEggs = c;
		this.hasBacon = d;
		this.hasOrangeJuice = e;
	}
	
	/* A getter gets things, i.e., namely in java and oop a getter is
	usually public so that it can RETURN private values, e.g., a getter 
	for slicesOfBacon tells other classes how many slices of bacon. */

	public int getSlicesOfBacon() {
		return this.slicesOfBacon;
	} 
	
	/* A getter returns a value, by contrast, a setter sets values. For
	example to set weather we have orangejuice, */

	public void setHasOrangeJuice(boolean a) {
		this.hasOrangeJuice = a;
	}  
}

4. An array of Breakfast
int [] numberz; //This is an array of numbers
char [] charz; //This is an array of chars
boolean [][] blocked; //This is a 2D array of booleans

Breakfast roedersBreakfast = new Breakfast(2, 4, true, true, true);

Breakfast [] roedersFamiliesBreakfasts = {roedersBreakfast, papasBreakFast,
mamasBreakfast, sisBreakfast, abuelaBreakFast, abueloBreakfast}

5. Using getters and setters:
roedersBreakfast.setSlicesOfBacon(12);
//This is using a setter!!

6.This is using a getter
